        <br>
        <p>I came across this recipe a few years ago when I was going through a 
            baking phase. Particularly a muffin baking phase. One of my roommates
            was a vegan and I also try to stick to vegan recipes when I can. I 
            also love lemone muffins and I love blueberry muffins so might as well
            combine the two! I have been obsessed with this recipe ever since and 
            have made it countless times by now. All my friends, vegan or not, love
            these muffins so they had to make the cut.
