        <h1>Breakup Salad Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Madeup Recipe</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A few months ago I was on a big salad kick. The weather was beautiful
            in Madrid, Spring started really early this year. Spring time is salad
            time. I ended up making this salad and became obsessed. When the guy I 
            was in love with came to visit me in Madrid a few weeks later and I made 
            it for him. He loved the salad so much that he went home and immediately
            made it. He made it for his friends and his family he thought it was that
            good. That's when I thought I had made my own version of the "Marry Me
            Chicken" (I don't eat meat). Boy was I wrong.
            After that trip I was head over heels in love, thinking I was going to marry 
            this boy. Well a week after coming back from Madrid things ended. So now
            it is the complete opposite of my own "Marry Me Chicken". But it's still
            really delicious, maybe just bad luck.
